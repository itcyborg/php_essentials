**Predefined php functions**

Free for use, modify, collaborate and improve

With these function you can perform several things including

- Connect to most database and run your query easily(It's as easy as passing the column names and their values)
- Deal with file uploads in a new way, just pass the file and let us handle the rest.
- Receive and handle errors generated.

**note:** _this project is still in early stages of development and a lot of changes may occur. Report any errors and/improvements._
